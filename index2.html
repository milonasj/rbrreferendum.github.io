        <p><b>Question #1 targets four areas</b></p>
<p><b>Meet Growing Enrollment Needs</b>: Current enrollment already exceeds building capacity and a recent demographic student predicts further significant increases.  To put it simply, RBR is starting to burst at the seams.</p>

<p><b>Ensure continuation of tuition revenue</b>: Dwindling classroom space will further reduce our ability to accept tuition paying out-of-district students, a large source of revenue for our district.  RBR taxpayers are now paying over $1.2 million more per year than we were just 4 years ago due to lost tuition revenue.</p>

<p><b>Improve our facilities for academic programs</b>: Our remarkable students, staff, and programs are housed in a facility that is nearly 50 years old.  No major change in the footprint has occurred since it was opened in 1975.  Modern learning spaces will inspire students and support programs aligned with 21st century needs.</p>

<p><b>Necessary Maintenance of Physical Plant</b>: The roof is approaching the end of its service life. Itâ€™s replacement is approximately $6.1 million.  A project this large cannot be paid for within the regular budget.</p>
<p><b>Question #2 addresses items identified in the strategic plan developed by our community and adopted in 2016.</b>  Included are the installation on an artificial turf field and a new concession stand with restrooms.</p>

      	  	<p>RBR is a unique school in many ways including the fact that since 1984 RBR has accepted out- of-district students that pay tuition either by parents or by their sending school districts. The tuition revenue we receive covers the cost to educate these students and also has covered the cost of all of our award-winning academy programs, all of our athletic programs, all of our extra-curricular activities and more. With more space being taken up by our own in-district students, we have had to accept fewer tuition students, thereby, limiting the revenue they bring with them to RBR. Our in-district taxpayers are picking up more of the bill than they used to cover when we had more of the tuition students coming to RBR. As previously stated, our tax- payers are now paying over $1.2M more per year than we were just 4 years ago due to lost tuition revenue.</p>
 
<p>If the Referendum fails the school will still need a new roof, will still have an increasing lack of space for our in-district students and will not have a mechanism to fund the needed work to accommodate them. We will also have a continuously decreasing revenue stream that will pass a larger bill onto the taxpayers. If the Referendum fails we may be faced with a difficult situation where our taxes will most likely still go up, we may have to cut programs, or we may have face some combination of both increased taxes AND fewer program offerings.</p>
